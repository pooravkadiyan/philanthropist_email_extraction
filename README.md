Myself Poorav Kadiyan, a former chess player and a hardcore ML guy. üòä

I really like training AI models and automating stuff, one of my recent projects was an AI model, that corrects lip movements while dubbing from one language to another. It was trained on 300k facial videos, to learn the phoneme mapping. 

And yeah I am a chess player, and even got to represent India in the Commonwealth 2019. I am also a part-time boxer.üòÖ

I am really good at Java followed by Python and Javascript.

Honestly, I have a lot of ideas in my head, that I want to convert into reality and I am looking for collaborations. 

I think that‚Äôs enough about me.ü§ê
